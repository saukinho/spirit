We charge a small fee to help us support the project just for the Pro features, and if you need more than 1,000 Public IPs.

## Spirit Pro
Buy a Spirit Pro license directly from the CLI `./spirit buy`
Every license helps support our development and server costs.

If you want to try a Pro feature, ask for a free Pro trial license.

## Key Features
- brute multiple ports at once
- brute using private keys
- filter out honeypots
- block hosts that are unreachable, filter your IP, have fail2ban, and so forth (less dull work, faster completion)
- try every connection twice before blocking to increase accuracy
- set your optimal timeout and concurrent threads
- by using coroutines (lightweight threads), we reduce server load by (a lot :)
- performant and accurate banner grabber included
- connect to all your found hosts concurrently, upload files, execute commands at once
- automatically cleans connection logs (if uid0)
