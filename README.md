# Spirit - Pentest Tools

Check out the helpfile [`$ ./spirit --help`](./HELP) to see the whole toolset.

## Example usage for SSH brute
```bash
# make sure your masscan command uses -oG open.lst for the results output file
$ masscan \
    --rate="50000" \
    --ports "22,222,2222,2212" 0.0.0.0/0 \
    --exclude 255.255.255.255 \
    -oG open.lst
Scanning 4294967295 hosts [4 ports/host]

$ ./spirit parse open.lst
INFO created h.lst in HOST:PORT format

$ ./spirit banner
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p  13% [=>                  ] [11s:1m15s]
INFO created b.lst in HOST:PORT:BANNER format

$ mv b.lst h.lst

# add passwords list
$ cat > p.lst << EOF
user1:pass1
user1:pass2
user2:pass50
EOF

$ ./spirit brute
INFO loaded h.lst with 26803 hosts
INFO loaded p.lst with 4881 logins

$ less -S found.lst
```

> Tip: you can automate these steps with `./spirit auto` or use the [`./go.sh`](./go.sh) script.

Upgrading 87% [========================>     ] (5.9/5.9 MB, 49.652 MB/s)
```
>*Spirit can self-upgrade only on amd64 aka x86-64 for now. [`donate to speed things up`](#monero-xmr-thank-you)

## Spirit is Free (sorta)
For `local IP` (10/172/192) ranges and up to 1,000 `public IPs`

If you need to pen-test more than 1,000 public IP or need Pro features we charge a small fee to help us support the project development. Use `./spirit buy` to upgrade.

## Spirit Pro
Buy a Spirit Pro license directly from the CLI `./spirit buy`. Every license helps support our development and server costs. If you want to try a Pro feature, ask for a free Pro trial license by opening an [issue](https://github.com/theaog/spirit/issues).

## Key Features
- extracts SSH banners accurately (retry failed hosts) and fast (many threads)
- brute multiple ports at once: 1.1.1.1:22, 1.1.1.1:23, etc.
- brute using private keys `./spirit brute-key --file id_rsa`
- brute auto-blocks honeypots not wasting time on them
- brute also blocks hosts that are unreachable, or have fail2ban installed (less dull work, faster scanning)
- brute will try every connection twice before blocking to increase accuracy
- set your optimal concurrent threads for banner and brute `--jobs`
- very light on server load (CPU and memory)
- connect to all your hosts concurrently, upload files and execute remote commands using `./spirit omni -c 'uptime'`
- clean connection logs (if uid0) using `./spirit zap`
- masscan whole zones automatically at your own pace `./spirit masscan --zone zone.lst --rate 10_000`
- continously scan & brute your network on random ports `./spirit forever` -- spot vulnerabilities before they happen
- and more...
