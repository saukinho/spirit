# Spirit - Pentest Tools

Check out the helpfile [`$ ./spirit --help`](./HELP) to see the whole toolset.

## Example usage for SSH brute
```bash
# make sure your masscan command uses -oG open.lst for the results output file
$ masscan \
    --rate="50000" \
    --ports "22,222,2222,2212" 0.0.0.0/0 \
    --exclude 255.255.255.255 \
    -oG open.lst
Scanning 4294967295 hosts [4 ports/host]

$ ./spirit parse open.lst
INFO created h.lst in HOST:PORT format

$ ./spirit banner

INFO created b.lst in HOST:PORT:BANNER format

$ mv b.lst h.lst

# add passwords list
$ cat > p.lst << EOF
user1:pass1
user1:pass2
user2:pass50
EOF

$ ./spirit brute

```
>*Spirit can self-upgrade only on amd64 aka x86-64 for now. [`donate to speed things up`](#monero-xmr-thank-you)

## Spirit is Free (sorta)
For `local IP` (10/172/192) ranges and up to 1,000 `public IPs`

If you need to pen-test more than 1,000 public IP or need Pro features we charge a small fee to help us support the project development. Use `./spirit buy` to upgrade.

## Spirit Pro
Buy a Spirit Pro license directly from the CLI `./spirit buy`

Every license helps support our development and server costs.

Licensing information can be found running `./spirit pro --info`.

If you want to try a Pro feature, ask for a free Pro trial license.

## Key Features
- brute multiple ports at once
- brute using private keys
- filter out honeypots
- block hosts that are unreachable, filter your IP, have fail2ban, and so forth (less dull work, faster completion)
- try every connection twice before blocking to increase accuracy
- set your optimal timeout and concurrent threads
- by using coroutines (lightweight threads), we reduce server load by (a lot :)
- performant and accurate banner grabber included
- connect to all your found hosts concurrently, upload files, execute commands at once
- automatically cleans connection logs (if uid0)
- masscan whole countries automatically `./spirit ms --country ir`
- continously scan your network on random ports `./spirit forever --help` and spot vulnerabilities before they happen
- and more... check out all the spirit tools! [`$ ./spirit --help`](./HELP)
> every tool has it's own helpfile, e.g. `./spirit ms --help`
